Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistical measure used to quantify the level of financial risk within a portfolio over a specific time frame. 
Different VaR measures provide insights into various aspects of risk, and here are definitions, calculations, and distinctions for the mentioned portfolio VaR measures:

# Individual VaR:
Individual VaR represents the potential loss in the value of a single asset or position within a portfolio.

# Incremental VaR:
Incremental VaR measures the impact of adding or removing a specific asset or position from a portfolio on the overall portfolio's VaR.

# Marginal VaR:
Marginal VaR is the partial derivative of the portfolio VaR concerning a small change in the allocation of a particular asset.

# Component VaR:
Component VaR breaks down the total portfolio VaR into individual asset contributions.

# Diversified Portfolio VaR:
Diversified Portfolio VaR considers the effects of diversification on the overall portfolio risk.
